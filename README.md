## About the Project

The 'Exploring CSS Fundamentals' project is a compilation of challenges and solutions from The Odin Project's "Intro to CSS" and "The Cascade" sections. This repository serves as a display for my answers to the challenges, as well as a place for me to use as a refresher to understand and applying CSS in web development.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive solutions to each of the [CSS Exercises from The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises/tree/main/foundations), providing insights into various CSS applications.

## Technologies

- **HTML:** Structuring the web content.
- **CSS:** Styling the HTML content.

## My Journey / About Me

- **Student:** Engaged in learning from The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp.
- **Academic Background:** Studied Computer Science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.
- **Professionally:** Working as a Content Manager with a keen interest in front-end development.

## Learning Outcomes / Objectives

- Apply styles to HTML using CSS.
- Utilize class and ID attributes effectively.
- Employ correct selectors to style specific elements.
- Understand the role of the cascade in CSS.
- Learn about specificity and combining CSS selectors.
- Comprehend how inheritance affects CSS properties.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially those that help style the surrounding page, as I kind of left it a bit ugly outside of just general structure. 

Please note that contributions should not alter the challenges or change the HTML structure.
